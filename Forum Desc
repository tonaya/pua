Hello,
We have the forum section of the backend(database) for the application.
The table already exist in the 'tables.sql' script provided and the name of the table is UserComments.
This table will store the comments and reviews entered by users.
In order for this to happen certain procedures are to be created..
Here is the list of possible procedures:
A procedure to;
1) add user comment
2) Retrive users comments for a given pu_loc_id(that is a polling unit)

Have fun,
Cheers!!!
