Hello,
This is the backend(database) of a polling application written in mysql. 
The database is made up of 8 tables, which are;

1)npu       -- Stores polling unit details.

2)Users     -- Stores information of a user of the application.

3) Gender   -- Stores the possible gender(sex) of a user.

4)Reviews   -- Stores a list of predefined reviews, which users can select from.

5)ElectionTypes  -- Stores information of the type of election e.g Presidential, senetorial etc.

6)ElectionEvents -- Stores information of electiontypes and the set dates for each election. 

7)UsersReview  -- Stores reviews entered by users from the list of predefined reviews, which are containd in the "Reviews" table.

8)UserComments  -- Stores comments entered by users( not predefined)


The scripts available in this projects are

1) tabledump.sql   -- This is a dump of the npu table. This table stores polling units and other details of a unit. This script should be executed first before all others.

2)tables.sql       -- This is an sql script for the creation of other tables in the database. It should be executed after "tabledump.sql".

3)pop.sql          -- This is an sql script that populates the tables with necessary information. It should be executed after "tables.sql".

4)proc.sql         -- This is an sql script which contains stored procedures that are used to manage the database.

So far, other sections of the database have been worked on. 

The forum section of the backend(database) for the application is what is left.
The table needed for this already exist in the 'tables.sql' script and the name of the table is "UserComments".
This table will store the comments  entered by users.
In order for the forum to be effective certain procedures are to be created..
Here is the list of possible procedures:

A procedure to;

1) add user comment

2) Retrive users comments for a given pu_loc_id(that is a polling unit)

Have fun.
Cheers!!!
